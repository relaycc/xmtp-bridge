**dev.test.ts**

I was going to change `npm run dev:up` to run each `npm run dev:*` command in a
single command, but I realized that goes against the "force the user to step
through the process" idea. I was looking at the `quickstart` section of the
readme, where it says "npm run dev:up and follow the error messages." and I
realized what we really need is "`npm run test:dev` and follow the error
messages." I think this is the way to go. Not only are we forcing the user to
step through the process but we're also defining that process with tests.

**Renamed services and prod.test.ts**

I moved a bunch of files around and realized that the `npm run prod:up` command
is for sure going to break but that we don't have a test that will tell us that.
So I added a skeleton test for that command.

**Changelog**

I pinged the team in Discord and asked if they had a minute to review this
stuff, but then I thought to myself that we've really been doing too much
synchronous communication, so I was thinking about where to write down an async
version of what I wanted to talk about, and I came up with this idea that every
changeset should come with a changelog file where the developer can write down
what they did and why and any open questions. Instead of putting comments at the
top-level in a pull request, we should make the comments on the changelog file.
