**fixed a typo in the Dockerfile**

**return the sent message in Bridge::send**

**add e2e smoke tests**

Added smoke tests and npm scripts that run them. The way it works:

First you start the database, migration, and api server.

    `"docker:api:up": ". ../shell/env.sh && ../shell/docker/api.up.sh"`

Next, you execute basic API tests. Most importantly, one of the tests signs up
for a new account. We save the sign up information in a temporary file.

    `"docker:api:test": ". ../shell/env.sh && mocha -g 'Use the API'"`

Now that we have signed up for an account, we start the bridge for that account.
We use the data in the temporary file to configure the bridge.

    `"docker:bridge:up": ". ../shell/env.sh && ../shell/docker/bridge.up.sh"`

Now that we have a bridge running, we test the forward and reverse proxy
functionalities. To test the reverse proxy, we use the webhook token in the
temporary file that we saved.

    `"docker:bridge:test": ". ../shell/env.sh && mocha -g 'Use the bridge'"`

And that's how it works. There's some pretty not great stuff in the temporary
file solution, but it works for now and solving it correctly will take a day or
more and we don't have that time right now.
