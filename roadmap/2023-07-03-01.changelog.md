**analyze.yml workflow and docker tests**

Add a GH action workflow that runs build, lint, format, and test on every PR
change.

The test bed is a docker compose cluster and the test runner is a local mocha
suite.

Part of adding the above included adding a prisma dockerfile that is used to run
migrations inside the test bed.

**renamed a few things to be more precise**

e2e -> mocha
lint -> eslint
format -> prettier
build -> tsc

In general, and all throughout the project, we're trying to name things as
precisely as possible _according to what you need to know to interface with the
named things_.
