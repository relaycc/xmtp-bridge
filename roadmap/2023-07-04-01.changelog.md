**add a bunch of env var checks and organization to scripts**

**update the env.ts file so that it doesn't make assumptions about the
environment usage, it just prints warning and centralizes reads**

**add an isBot property to bridge that controls whether or not it responds after
forwarding a message**

**add unhandled error handling to express so the process doesn't crash**

**add a canaryAddress field to the bridge config, this is a big hack, needs to
change**

**add a whitelist option to the forward proxy (specifically to allow for a
canary address to send it messages without triggering the customer's bot)**

**add a workbench test file that can run some queries against production db**

**added new e2e test files for specific cases**

The basic idea is that we will have the following primary e2e files:

- dev.test.ts
- docker.test.ts
- prod.api.test.ts
- prod.bridge.test.ts

dev is for validating your dev env
docker is for validating your changes before requesting code review
prod.api is for testing the live production api
prod.bridge is for testing any of the live production bridges

Overall, I'm not super happy about the current state of the codebase. In
particular, entrypoints are not super well defined, don't have much error
handling and logging, are not very well tested, and the general patterns are not
documented. This needs to get done ASAP.

**update api.deploy.yaml to use new npm scripts**
